# captchaSolver

In the notebook provided in this repo, I train a captcha solver model that can solve captchas of the length 5. the captcha can include both alphabets and numbers. in the data
that I had(samples.zip) the captchas had 19 different characters but you can train a model with this notebook on a more comprehensive dataset that includes all alphabets and 
numbers, it needs a little bit of change. 

all other necessary explanations are given within the notebook.
